## Run the simple web UI

A minimal single-page UI is included at `static/index.html` so you can ask questions from a browser.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (zsh):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

2. Install the package (this will install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Set required environment variables in your shell (replace with your real tokens):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export RENDER_OPEN_AI_AUTH_TOKEN="your-ui-token"
```

4. Run the FastAPI app with uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

5. Open the UI in your browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Enter your question and the auth token you set in `RENDER_OPEN_AI_AUTH_TOKEN` and click Ask.

Notes:
- The app expects a valid OpenAI key in `OPENAI_API_KEY` and a UI auth token in `RENDER_OPEN_AI_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- If `RENDER_OPEN_AI_AUTH_TOKEN` is left as the default `changeme`, the server will reject requests; set it before running.
